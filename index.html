  <p> Please run the following command in your minecraft game: </p>

      <p>While the game is running, you can configure events through the
        extension config page</p>

    <p>The mod allows you to set up your own events if you wish. I will guide
      you through making your own events: </p>
      <ol>
    <li><p>After running the mod for the first time, navigate to the minecraft
      directory and enter into the config directory. There is a file called
    <code>streamparticipation.json</code>. Open this file with any text editor.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you are going to create events, delete all text from
      <code>"players": {</code> to <code>"allowedEvents": {</code></p></li>
    <li><p>Each event is written under allowedEvents in the following format:
      <code> "NAME": {
        "enabled": true,
        "cost": 50-10000 in increments of 50,
        "command": "COMMAND TO RUN"
      },</code></p></li>
      <li><p>For instance, if I want to make an event that clears the weather for
        600 bits, I would write the following after allowedEvents:
        <code>"weather/clear": {
          "enabled": true,
          "cost": 600,
          "command": "/weather clear"
        },</code></p></li>
      </ol>
    <p>You can also run functions for more powerful events!</p>

    <p>Finally, information about the transaction is stored in NBT for later use. The following is how it is stored:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>NBT Path</th>
        <th>Data</th>
      </tr>
      <td>streamparticipation userDisplayName</td>
      <td>User who called event</td>
      <tr>
        <td>streamparticipation rewardCost</td>
        <td>Amount of bits used</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>streamparticipation rewardTitle</td>
        <td>Name of event</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
